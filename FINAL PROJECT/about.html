			Legs by Liz
		</h3>
		<p id="pOne">
			<br>Legs by Liz was founded in January 2016 by Liz Mulshine, a Jersey born and bred Upstate New Yorker, yoga-enthusiast, nurse and mother of four. 
			<br>
			<br>She was introduced to the world of spandex 11 years ago when her eldest daughter asked Liz if she could make her a ski suit, which also led to making one for her daughter's best friend, her other friend, and then the ski suit business began. She's been making suits for her childrens' highschool and college ski teams ever since at no charge.

			<p id="pThree">
			<br>The yoga pants started in a similar way. She made a pair for herself and then her friends. Advertising was simple as more people started wearing her pants and telling people about them.
<br>
			<br>As a result, orders are coming in fast and Liz is turning her hobby into a business experiment, hoping that this experiment might become a lifestyle and this lifestyle remains a part of her life she can share with you.
